# Simple bot
On this rep, I will upload my simple javascript bots for RSPS. These are very simple and are more of a lesson for me then a real bot for the public, however you are ofcourse free to use them!

## How to use?
Install node.js (you can find this on google)
Be sure to enable the checkmark in the node.js installer so it can download every dependable it needs.
Run this command from an administrative shell to install the "software" dependencies (Visual Studio, Python) on windows:
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

Then install node-gyp globally:
npm install -g node-gyp

As last try installing the package again (do this in visual code studio):
npm install robotjs
